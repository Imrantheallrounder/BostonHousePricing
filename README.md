# BostonHousePricing
### ML and Data Science on Boston housing price prediction.This is an End to End ML project.
## Software and Tools required:

1. [GitHub](https://github.com)
2. [HerokuAccount](https://heroku.com)
3. [VsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. [GitCLI](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-The-Command-Line)

Create a new environment

'''
conda create -p venv python==3.7 -y
'''

## Steps Towards the Project:
1.  ### MAKING THE MODEL
    ### First we loaded the Boston Dataset. Then applied EDA-> Exploratory Data Analysis.
    ### Standardized the Dataset so that gradient Descent converges quickly. Splitted the data into train and test.
    ### Made the Linear Regression model and trained the model using training data.
    ### Then evaluated the model on test data.
    ### Saved the model into a pickle file so that it can be used in future.
2.  ### CREATE NEW REPOSITORY ON GITHUB
    ### Create repository on GitHub and initialize it with readme, igtignore file etc.
    ### Using GitCLI clone the repository locally and add boston jupyter notebook and model in the same folder.
    ### Connect to the remote repository and push the changes in the main branch.
